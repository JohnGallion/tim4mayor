                Hi I'm Tim Weaver. My wife and I have been married and lived in the city of Hiram for 33 years and have raised two daughters. They both went to Hiram elementary, East Paulding/Dobbins middle school, and both graduated from Hiram High school. I also have two granddaughters. I'm a devout Christian and member of Riverside COG in Powder Springs. I love spending time with my family and watching my granddaughters play softball.
